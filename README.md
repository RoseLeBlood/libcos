A simple lib C 

libcos is a very simple biblothek for os developers. It contains simple functions that you need in everyday kernel development.

Porting to the required target platform is very easy. All you have to do is fill in the functions in "src/arch/user/port.c" for the corresponding platform and configuration add include/private/libconfig.h
